// METRIC INFO DEFINITIONS (What/Why/How)
// ============================================================================

const metricInfoDefinitions: Record<string, MetricInfo> = {
  companiesMet: {
    what: 'This metric tracks the average number of unique companies that mentors engage with during office hours sessions over a calendar year.',
    why: 'We track this to ensure mentors are providing broad value across our portfolio and building diverse connections. Higher numbers indicate mentors are accessible to a wide range of companies.',
    how: 'Calculated by counting unique companies each mentor meets with in OH sessions, then averaging across all active mentors for the year.',
  },
  avgOHMeetings90Days: {
    what: 'This shows the average number of office hours meetings portfolio companies complete in their first 90 days, excluding companies with zero meetings.',
    why: 'Early engagement is critical for new portfolio companies. This helps us identify if companies are getting the support they need during their onboarding period.',
    how: 'Count total OH meetings for each portco in days 0-90, exclude companies with zero meetings, then calculate the average across remaining companies.',
  },
  portcosMeetingRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of portfolio companies and member companies that schedule at least one office hours meeting within their first 90 days.',
    why: 'This metric helps us understand onboarding effectiveness. Low rates may indicate barriers to engagement or lack of awareness about available resources.',
    how: 'Divide the number of companies with ≥1 OH meeting in first 90 days by total number of new companies, multiply by 100.',
  },
  totalUtilization: {
    what: 'The percentage of offered office hours slots that result in completed (attended) meetings.',
    why: 'This helps us balance mentor availability with demand. Low utilization suggests oversupply; high utilization may indicate we need more mentor capacity.',
    how: 'Divide total number of attended OH sessions by total number of OH slots offered by mentors, multiply by 100.',
  },
  platformRating: {
    what: 'The average star rating (1-5 scale) across all completed and rated office hours sessions.',
    why: 'Session quality is our primary success metric. This helps us monitor overall satisfaction and identify when intervention may be needed.',
    how: 'Sum all star ratings from completed sessions, divide by total number of rated sessions. Calculated separately for mentor and mentee ratings, then averaged.',
  },
  ratingCoverage: {
    what: 'The percentage of completed office hours sessions that receive a rating from participants.',
    why: 'Higher coverage gives us better data quality for decision-making. Low coverage may indicate friction in the rating process or lack of user engagement.',
    how: 'Divide number of sessions with at least one rating by total number of completed sessions, multiply by 100.',
  },
  ratingDistributionSummary: {
    what: 'A summary view showing what percentage of ratings fall into the high-quality category (4-5 stars).',
    why: 'This quickly tells us if the platform is delivering value. We aim for 75%+ of sessions to receive 4-5 star ratings.',
    how: 'Count all 4-star and 5-star ratings, divide by total ratings, multiply by 100.',
  },
  confirmationRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of pending booking requests that successfully move to confirmed status.',
    why: 'Low confirmation rates indicate friction in the booking process or mentor unresponsiveness. This helps us identify where the booking flow breaks down.',
    how: 'Divide number of bookings that reached "confirmed" status by total number of bookings created, multiply by 100.',
  },
  avgTimeToConfirm: {
    what: 'The average time (in hours) between when a booking is requested and when it is confirmed by the mentor.',
    why: 'Faster confirmation creates better user experience for mentees. Long delays may indicate mentors need reminders or the process needs simplification.',
    how: 'Calculate time difference between booking creation and confirmation for all confirmed bookings, then average across all bookings.',
  },
  expirationRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of pending bookings that expire due to the 7-day timeout before being confirmed.',
    why: 'High expiration rates signal mentor engagement issues or unclear expectations. This helps us identify mentors who may need support.',
    how: 'Divide number of bookings that reached "expired" status by total number of bookings created, multiply by 100.',
  },
  pendingRequests: {
    what: 'The current number of tier override requests awaiting coordinator approval or denial.',
    why: 'Pending requests represent mentees waiting for access to mentors. High numbers may indicate we need to review tier policies or increase coordinator capacity.',
    how: 'Count all tier override requests with status = "pending" at the current moment.',
  },
  avgDecisionTime: {
    what: 'The average time (in days) between when a tier override request is submitted and when a coordinator makes a decision.',
    why: 'Faster decisions improve mentee experience and reduce frustration. This helps us monitor coordinator workload and responsiveness.',
    how: 'Calculate time difference between request creation and decision timestamp, then average across all reviewed requests in last 30 days.',
  },
  approvalRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of tier override requests that coordinators approve (versus deny).',
    why: 'This helps us calibrate our tier policies. Very high rates may mean tiers are too restrictive; very low rates may indicate users misunderstand the override process.',
    how: 'Divide number of approved requests by total number of reviewed requests (approved + denied), multiply by 100.',
  },
  utilizationRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of approved tier overrides that result in an actual booking between the mentee and mentor.',
    why: 'Low utilization suggests we may be approving unnecessary overrides. High utilization validates that the override process serves a real need.',
    how: 'Divide number of approved overrides with at least one resulting booking by total number of approved overrides, multiply by 100.',
  },
  activeMentors: {
    what: 'The number and percentage of registered mentors who have had at least one office hours session in the last 30 days.',
    why: 'Active mentors are our core resource. Tracking this helps us identify engagement trends and mentors who may need re-engagement outreach.',
    how: 'Count mentors with ≥1 completed OH session in last 30 days, divide by total registered mentors, multiply by 100 for percentage.',
  },
  activeMentees: {
    what: 'The number and percentage of registered mentees who have had at least one office hours session in the last 30 days.',
    why: 'This helps us understand mentee engagement and identify companies that may need additional encouragement to use the platform.',
    how: 'Count mentees with ≥1 completed OH session in last 30 days, divide by total registered mentees, multiply by 100 for percentage.',
  },
  dormantUsers: {
    what: 'The total count of users (mentors and mentees) who have not had any office hours activity in the last 90 days.',
    why: 'Dormant users represent untapped potential. High numbers may indicate we need better engagement campaigns or to understand barriers to participation.',
    how: 'Count all users with zero completed OH sessions in last 90 days, broken down by mentor and mentee roles.',
  },
  onboardingSuccess: {
    what: 'The percentage of newly registered users who complete their first booking within 14 days of joining the platform.',
    why: 'Early success predicts long-term engagement. Low rates indicate onboarding friction or unclear value proposition.',
    how: 'Divide number of new users with ≥1 booking in first 14 days by total number of new user registrations, multiply by 100.',
  },
  cancellationRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of confirmed bookings that are canceled by either party before the scheduled time.',
    why: 'High cancellation rates waste time and create poor user experience. This helps us understand reliability and identify problematic patterns.',
    how: 'Divide number of canceled bookings by total number of confirmed bookings, multiply by 100. Broken down by who initiated the cancellation.',
  },
  lateCancellationRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of cancellations that occur less than 2 hours before the scheduled meeting time.',
    why: 'Late cancellations are particularly disruptive and may impact reputation scores. We aim to keep this below 3%.',
    how: 'Count cancellations where (meeting_time - cancellation_time) < 2 hours, divide by total confirmed bookings, multiply by 100.',
  },
  repeatBookingRate: {
    what: 'The percentage of mentees who book a second session with the same mentor after their first meeting.',
    why: 'Repeat bookings indicate good mentor-mentee matching and valuable sessions. This validates our matching algorithm quality.',
    how: 'Count mentees with ≥2 bookings with same mentor, divide by total mentees with ≥1 booking, multiply by 100.',
  },
  avg90DayBooking: {
    what: 'This chart shows the average number of office hours bookings completed by portfolio companies in their first 90 days, comparing Community and Ventures cohorts over time.',
    why: 'We track this to understand engagement trends across different portfolio segments and identify if early-stage support needs are being met consistently year over year.',
    how: 'For each year, calculate the average OH bookings in first 90 days for companies in each cohort.',
  },
  weeklyYoY: {
    what: 'This chart compares weekly office hours activity for the current year versus the prior year, showing trends over 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month periods.',
    why: 'Year-over-year comparisons help us identify growth trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of program changes.',
    how: 'Count total OH sessions per week for current year and prior year, then plot them together for visual comparison.',
  },
  ratingDistribution: {
    what: 'This chart shows how many sessions received each star rating (1-5 stars), giving a visual breakdown of session quality.',
    why: 'Understanding the full distribution helps us see not just the average rating, but whether we have a quality problem with low-rated sessions.',
    how: 'Count the number of completed and rated sessions that received each star rating value (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars).',
  },
  weeklyActiveUsers: {
    what: 'This chart tracks the number of active mentors and active mentees each week over a 12-week period.',
    why: 'Weekly trends help us spot engagement changes quickly and understand if both sides of the marketplace are growing together.',
    how: 'For each week, count unique mentors and unique mentees with at least one completed OH session.',
  },
  bookingFunnel: {
    what: 'This funnel visualization shows how many users progress through each stage of the booking lifecycle.',
    why: 'Funnel analysis reveals where users drop off, helping us identify friction points and optimize conversion rates.',
    how: 'Count unique users at each stage (Created, Confirmed, Completed, Rated), calculate percentage of previous stage.',
