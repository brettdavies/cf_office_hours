We partner with [Product] [Product], [Product], and Senior [Product] [Product] to serve their patients with regular, recurring communication, disease-specific, and health/wellness education. We are based in Austin, TX, we are fully operational, we are generating revenue, and we are delighting a rapidly growing number of patients. LD offers a unique and valuable approach to addressing the most pressing issues in healthcare. Each year over $2[Product] (literally 90% of the nation’s annual healthcare expenditures) is spent on chronic and acute disease management. Yet with over 44 million Americans eligible for a [Product]-reimbursed chronic care management program, fewer than 1.5% take advantage of this federal initiative. Often the patient’s healthcare practitioner isn’t staffed to be able to deliver this needed service. And [Product]-19 has exacerbated the problem, as fewer than 40% of [Product] in the U.S. have had a clinical encounter (in person or by telehealth) since the start of the pandemic, and mental health issues (anxiety, social isolation, loneliness) are on the increase in the senior population.

With that said, there are multiple avenues for expansion, including technology improvements, population health, and physical expansion to other cities around the U.S. LD is raising $1.5M to expand our offering and to obtain market share.
