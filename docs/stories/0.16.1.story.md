# Story 0.16.1: Manual Pre-Deployment Testing & Logging Enhancement

## Status

In Progress

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to manually test all Epic 0 functionality, add comprehensive logging, and fix the magic link redirect bug,
**so that** we can deploy confidently knowing critical paths work and can debug production issues.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Console Logging Added (Auth Flow):**
   - Log magic link send (email, redirectUrl, timestamp)
   - Log Supabase auth callback (access_token presence, hash params, query params)
   - Log session creation (userId, timestamp, success/fail)
   - Log user profile fetch (userId, role, API response status)
   - Log signOut events

2. **Console Logging Added (Booking Flow):**
   - Log slot selection (slotId, menteeId, mentorId, slot availability status)
   - Log booking form submission (meetingGoal length, API call initiated)
   - Log booking API response (bookingId, status, error if any)
   - Log booking confirmation display (success/error state)

3. **Console Logging Added (Availability Flow):**
   - Log availability block creation (date, start/end time, slot duration, location)
   - Log slot generation (count of slots created)
   - Log availability save success/failure

4. **Console Logging Added (API Layer):**
   - Create API request logging middleware
   - Log all API requests: method, endpoint, userId (if authenticated), timestamp, status code
   - Log API errors: endpoint, error message, userId, statusCode

5. **Logging Format Standardized:**
   - Pattern: `[CATEGORY] Action description { contextKey: value, ... }`
   - Categories: AUTH, PROFILE, AVAILABILITY, BOOKING, API, ERROR
   - Example: `console.log('[BOOKING] Slot booked successfully', { slotId, menteeId, bookingId, timestamp: Date.now() });`

6. **Manual Test Checklist Created & Executed:**
   - Checklist template created in `docs/qa/0.16.1-manual-test-checklist.md`
   - Human engineer executes checklist (all items documented below)
   - Results documented in `docs/qa/0.16.1-manual-testing-results.md`
   - Gaps classified as BLOCKER / IMPORTANT / MINOR

7. **Fix Magic Link Redirect Bug (BLOCKER):**
   - User clicks magic link â†’ redirected to `/auth/callback`
   - Session establishes properly via Supabase auth
   - User redirected to `/dashboard` (NOT back to `/auth/login`)
   - Enhanced logging shows auth state transitions clearly
   - No race condition between CallbackPage effect and `onAuthStateChange` listener
   - Test with 3 different emails to confirm fix

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Epic 0 - Walking Skeleton:** This story is the FINAL step before deployment (Stories 17-18). It validates all Epic 0 functionality works end-to-end and adds debugging capability for production.

**Story Rationale:**
- Walking Skeleton philosophy: Validate working software before deploying
- Manual testing faster than E2E automation for 16 stories (E2E deferred to Epic 1)
- Console logging provides debugging capability in production (before full observability in Epic 1+)
- Magic link redirect bug is BLOCKER found during analysis

**Critical Bug Fix:**
- **Issue:** Race condition in auth flow causes redirect to `/auth/login` after clicking magic link
- **Root Cause:** `isLoading` in `useAuth` hook incorrectly returns `false` before `getSession()` completes
- **Fix:** Add `isInitializing` state to track first auth check, update `isLoading` logic
- **Impact:** BLOCKER - prevents users from logging in via magic link

**Dependencies:**
- All Stories 0-16 complete
- Local development environment working (Supabase, API, frontend)
- Access to Supabase Inbucket mailbox for magic link testing

**Enables:**
- Story 17: Cloudflare Workers deployment
- Story 18: Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Confident production deployment with working auth flow and debugging logs

### Division of Labor (Agent vs. Human)

**Agent Engineer Tasks (70-75% of work):**
- Add console logging to all critical paths (~3 hours)
- Create API request logging middleware (~30 mins)
- Fix magic link redirect bug (~1 hour)
- Create manual test checklist template (~30 mins)
- Create gap documentation template (~15 mins)
- Run automated tests to verify no regressions (~15 mins)
- Implement BLOCKER fixes identified by human (1-4 hours if needed)

**Human Engineer Tasks (25-30% of work):**
- Execute manual test checklist (~2-3 hours)
- Document functionality gaps (~30 mins)
- Classify gaps as BLOCKER/IMPORTANT/MINOR (~15 mins)
- Re-test after BLOCKER fixes (~30 mins)
- Make deployment decision (~5 mins)

**Why This Split Works:**
- Agent handles repetitive code changes (logging, middleware)
- Agent can fix bugs with clear requirements
- Human handles judgment calls (is this broken? is this acceptable?)
- Human handles physical testing (clicking UI, checking emails)

### Console Logging Pattern

**Standard Format:**
```typescript
console.log('[CATEGORY] Action description', { contextKey: value, ... });
```

**Categories:**
- `[AUTH]` - Authentication flow
- `[PROFILE]` - User profile operations
- `[AVAILABILITY]` - Mentor availability
- `[BOOKING]` - Booking flow
- `[API]` - API requests (middleware)
- `[ERROR]` - Error conditions

**Context Fields (always include):**
- `timestamp: Date.now()` or `new Date().toISOString()`
- `userId` (if authenticated)
- Action-specific fields: `slotId`, `bookingId`, `email`, `mentorId`, etc.

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Auth
console.log('[AUTH] Magic link sent', { email, redirectUrl, timestamp: Date.now() });
console.log('[AUTH] Session established', { userId: session.user.id, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });

// Booking
console.log('[BOOKING] Slot selected', { slotId, menteeId, mentorId, available: !slot.is_booked });
console.log('[BOOKING] Booking created', { bookingId, slotId, menteeId, mentorId, timestamp: Date.now() });

// API (middleware)
console.log('[API] GET /users/me', { userId, statusCode: 200, timestamp: Date.now() });

// Errors
console.error('[ERROR] Booking creation failed', { error: err.message, userId, slotId, timestamp: Date.now() });
```

**DEV Mode Only:**
Wrap logs in `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` to avoid production console spam (Epic 1 replaces with structured logging).

### Magic Link Redirect Bug - Technical Details

**File:** `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

**Current Code (Line 209):**
```typescript
isLoading: session !== null && user === null,
```

**Problem:**
- On initial render: `session = null`, `user = null` â†’ `isLoading = false`
- `CallbackPage` checks `if (!isLoading && !isAuthenticated)` â†’ redirects to login
- `onAuthStateChange` fires AFTER redirect, session established too late

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Add state
const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(true);

// In useEffect, after getSession():
supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session }, error }) => {
  setIsInitializing(false); // Mark initial check complete
  // ... existing logic
});

// Update return value
return {
  // ...
  isLoading: isInitializing || (session !== null && user === null),
  // ...
};
```

**Verification:**
- Test with 3 different emails (as per AC 7)
- Check console logs show proper sequence:
  1. `[CallbackPage] Component rendered` (hasAuthParams: true)
  2. `[useAuth] getSession result` (hasSession: true)
  3. `[CallbackPage] User authenticated, redirecting to: /dashboard`
  4. NO `[CallbackPage] No auth params found, redirecting to login`
