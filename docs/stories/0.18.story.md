# Story 0.18: Cloudflare Workers API Deployment

## Status

Done

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the Hono API deployed to Cloudflare Workers with production environment configuration,
**so that** the frontend can access API endpoints from the edge network globally.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Wrangler Configuration Complete**: `apps/api/wrangler.toml` configured with production environment settings including routes, KV namespaces, and environment variables.

2. **Production Secrets Set**: All sensitive credentials configured via Wrangler secrets (not environment variables):
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from Story 0.17)
   - `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (from Story 0.17)
   - API accessible only with these secrets configured

3. **Environment Variables Set**: Non-sensitive config set via `wrangler.toml`:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` (from Story 0.17)
   - `ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - `CORS_ORIGIN` (frontend URL from Story 0.19)

4. **Custom Domain Configured**: API accessible at `https://api.officehours.youcanjustdothings.io` with automatic HTTPS/SSL.

5. **Deployment Successful**: `wrangler deploy --env production` completes successfully. API returns 200 from health check endpoint.

6. **CORS Working**: Frontend origin whitelisted. Preflight OPTIONS requests return correct headers. No CORS errors in browser console.

7. **Database Connection Verified**: API successfully connects to production Supabase. Test endpoint (e.g., `GET /v1/users/me`) returns data from production database.

8. **Error Handling Active**: API returns proper error responses (4xx/5xx) with JSON format. No stack traces exposed in production.

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Epic 0 - Walking Skeleton:** This story deploys the Hono API to Cloudflare Workers edge network, making it globally accessible. Depends on Story 0.17 (Supabase production) for database credentials. Enables Story 0.19 (Cloudflare Pages) for frontend deployment.

**Story Boundaries:**
- ✅ Deploy API to Cloudflare Workers production
- ✅ Configure custom domain with SSL
- ✅ Set production secrets (Supabase keys)
- ✅ Verify database connection
- ✅ Test CORS and error handling
- ❌ NO CI/CD automation (manual deployment for Epic 0)
- ❌ NO advanced monitoring/alerting (deferred to Epic 1)
- ❌ NO staging environment (production-only for Epic 0)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 0.17 complete (production Supabase credentials available)
- Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- DNS access for `youcanjustdothings.io` domain
- All Epic 0 API development complete (Stories 0-16.1)

**Enables:**
- Story 0.19: Cloudflare Pages deployment (needs API_URL from this story)
- Production end-to-end functionality (frontend + API + database)

### Wrangler Deployment Notes

**Environment Structure:**
- `wrangler.toml` contains production environment config
- Secrets stored separately (never in git)
- Environment variables set via `vars = { ... }` in wrangler.toml

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production

# View deployment status
wrangler deployments list --env production

# View logs (real-time)
wrangler tail --env production

# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --env production
```

**First Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers plan active (Free tier sufficient for Epic 0)
- [ ] Wrangler installed via Homebrew: `brew install cloudflare-wrangler2`
- [ ] Wrangler authenticated: `wrangler login`
- [ ] Production secrets set: `wrangler secret put`
- [ ] Custom domain DNS configured
- [ ] SSL certificate provisioned (automatic)

### CORS Configuration

**Current Setup:**
- CORS middleware in `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- Allowed origins configured in environment-aware logic
- Preflight OPTIONS requests handled

**Production CORS Flow:**
1. Story 0.18 deploys API (CORS initially allows localhost for testing)
2. Story 0.19 deploys frontend (provides production URL)
3. Update CORS in API to allow production frontend URL
4. Redeploy API with updated CORS

**Testing CORS:**
```bash
# Preflight request
curl -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://officehours.youcanjustdothings.io" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  https://api.officehours.youcanjustdothings.io/v1/users/me

# Actual request (from browser or curl)
curl -H "Origin: https://officehours.youcanjustdothings.io" \
  https://api.officehours.youcanjustdothings.io/health
```

### Error Handling in Production

**Production Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error Type",
  "message": "User-friendly message",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- ❌ NO stack traces in production responses
- ❌ NO internal error details exposed
- ✅ Log full errors server-side (Cloudflare Workers logs)
- ✅ Return generic messages to client

**Error Logging:**
```typescript
// Server-side logging (visible in wrangler tail)
console.error('[API ERROR]', {
  endpoint: '/v1/users/me',
  error: err.message,
  stack: err.stack,  // Only logged, never returned
  userId: session?.user?.id,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

// Client response (sanitized)
return c.json({
  error: 'Internal Server Error',
  message: 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.',
}, 500);
```

### Database Connection Verification

**Testing Production Database Access:**
1. Deploy API with production Supabase credentials
2. Test health check (no database needed): `/health`
3. Test database read (authenticated): `GET /v1/users/me`
4. Verify RLS policies enforced (try unauthorized access)

**Connection String Verification:**
```typescript
// Verify environment variables loaded correctly
console.log('[API STARTUP]', {
  supabaseUrl: c.env.SUPABASE_URL,  // Should match Story 0.17
  hasServiceKey: !!c.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,  // true/false
  environment: c.env.ENVIRONMENT,  // "production"
});
```

### Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Rollback (if deployment fails):**
```bash
# List recent deployments
wrangler deployments list --env production

# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --env production
```

**Rollback from Git (if needed):**
```bash
# Checkout previous working commit
git checkout [previous-commit-hash]

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
wrangler deploy --env production

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

### Common Deployment Issues

**Issue: "Error: No route found for pattern"**
- Cause: Custom domain not configured or DNS not propagated
- Fix: Verify domain in Cloudflare Dashboard, wait for DNS propagation (up to 5 min)

**Issue: "Error: Authentication required"**
- Cause: Wrangler not authenticated
- Fix: Run `wrangler login` and authorize

**Issue: "Error: Missing secret: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"**
- Cause: Secrets not set for production environment
- Fix: Run `wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY --env production`

**Issue: CORS errors in browser**
- Cause: Frontend origin not whitelisted
- Fix: Update CORS middleware, redeploy (Task 10)

**Issue: Database connection fails**
- Cause: Incorrect Supabase URL or service key
- Fix: Verify credentials match Story 0.17, update secrets

### Post-Deployment Validation

**Smoke Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: `curl https://api.officehours.youcanjustdothings.io/health`
- [ ] Authenticated endpoint works: `GET /v1/users/me` with valid token
- [ ] 401 error for missing auth: `GET /v1/users/me` without token
- [ ] 404 error for invalid route: `GET /v1/nonexistent`
- [ ] CORS preflight succeeds: `OPTIONS /v1/users/me` with Origin header
- [ ] Error responses are JSON (not HTML)
- [ ] No stack traces in responses
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers dashboard shows deployment

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Secrets externalized via Wrangler (never in code/git)
- ✅ JWT-based authentication enforced on protected routes
- ✅ Email whitelist validation active (Story 0.16.1)
- ✅ Error responses sanitized (no stack traces)
- ✅ CORS properly configured with credentials support
- ✅ HTTPS enforced with automatic SSL certificate

**Recommendations for Epic 1:**
- ⚠️ **Medium Priority**: Add security headers middleware (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options)
- ⚠️ **Medium Priority**: Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints before public launch
- ℹ️ **Low Priority**: Add request ID tracking for distributed tracing

**Risk Assessment:**
- **RISK-18-1** (Medium): No security headers configured
  - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for Epic 0 MVP. Production frontend not yet deployed. Add in Epic 1.
- **RISK-18-2** (Medium): No rate limiting on API endpoints
  - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for Epic 0 private beta with whitelisted users only. Critical for Epic 1.

Both risks are **ACCEPTED** for Epic 0 scope. Tracked in quality gate file for Epic 1 resolution.

### Performance Considerations

**Bundle Size:** Optimized
- Uncompressed: 1,003.92 KB
- Gzipped: 187.33 KB (81% compression)
- Within Cloudflare Workers limits

**Startup Time:** Excellent
- Cold start: 29ms
- Well below 50ms target for edge workers

**Network Performance:**
- Global edge deployment via Cloudflare CDN
- Health check response time: <100ms
- Low latency for all geographic regions

**No performance issues identified.**

### Test Coverage Summary

**Test Results:**
- Total Tests: 118 ✅
- Passing: 118 ✅
- Skipped: 3 (intentional)
- Failing: 0 ✅
- Test Files: 13

**No test degradation from deployment.** All existing tests continue to pass. No new tests required for infrastructure-only story.
