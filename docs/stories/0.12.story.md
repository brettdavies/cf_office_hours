## Dev Notes

### Consolidation with Story 0.11

**IMPORTANT:** This story's functionality was fully implemented as part of Story 0.11 (Booking Creation API). The BookingFormModal component created in Story 0.10 was enhanced in Story 0.11 to include:

- Complete form functionality with validation
- API integration via apiClient.createBooking()
- Comprehensive error handling for all status codes
- Success/error toast notifications
- Slot list refresh after booking creation

The original plan was to implement the API in Story 0.11 and the form in Story 0.12, but for efficiency and to ensure a cohesive implementation, both were completed together in Story 0.11.

### Implementation Details

**Component Location:** `apps/web/src/components/features/bookings/BookingFormModal.tsx`

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Form Validation:**
   - Client-side check: meeting_goal >= 10 characters
   - User-friendly error message via toast

2. **API Integration:**
   - Calls `apiClient.createBooking({ time_slot_id, meeting_goal })`
   - Loading state with "Creating..." button text
   - Disabled form inputs during submission

3. **Error Handling:**
   - 409 Conflict: "This slot was just booked by another user"
   - 404 Not Found: "This time slot is no longer available"
   - 401/403 Auth: "Please log in again"
   - Generic error: "Unable to create booking. Please try again"

4. **User Experience:**
   - Success toast on booking creation
   - Modal auto-closes after success
   - Form resets when modal closes
   - Callback triggers slot list refresh

5. **Epic 0 Constraints:**
   - Materials URLs field present but disabled
   - Labeled as "Coming Soon" for Epic 4
   - No calendar conflict checking (Epic 3)
   - Status always 'pending' (confirmation flow in Epic 4)

### Testing

All testing for this story's functionality was completed in Story 0.11:

**Component Tests:** `apps/web/src/components/features/bookings/BookingFormModal.test.tsx`
- Form rendering and validation
- Success toast on booking creation
- Error toast on API failures
- Modal close behavior
- Loading states during submission

**API Client Tests:** `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.test.ts`
- createBooking() method tests
- Request/response handling
- Error handling for all status codes

**Test Coverage:** 15 tests covering all acceptance criteria

### Previous Story References

- **Story 0.10** (Slot Picker UI): Created BookingFormModal stub component
- **Story 0.11** (Booking Creation API): Implemented full form functionality + API integration
- **Story 0.8** (Create Availability API): Backend slots endpoint consumed by this flow
- **Story 0.4** (Auth Middleware): Authentication for booking endpoint

### Architecture References

**Source:** [Section 7, architecture/7-frontend-architecture.md]

Form handling follows React Hook Form pattern (deferred to Epic 2):
- Story 0.11 uses simple React state for Epic 0 simplicity
- React Hook Form + Zod validation will be added in Epic 2 stories

**Source:** [Section 6.4.2, architecture/6-components.md]

Booking components architecture:
- BookingFormModal: Dialog-based form component
- SlotPickerList: Parent component that opens modal
- Separation of concerns: presentation vs. data fetching

**Source:** [Section 14.10, architecture/14-coding-standards.md]

Error handling standards:
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for all outcomes

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

N/A - Work completed in Story 0.11

### Debug Log References

See Story 0.11 for implementation details

### Completion Notes

This story documents functionality that was implemented as part of Story 0.11 for the following reasons:

1. **Cohesion:** The booking API and form are tightly coupled - implementing them together ensured proper error handling and data flow
2. **Efficiency:** Avoiding context switching between API implementation and form implementation
3. **Testing:** Comprehensive tests could validate the full booking flow end-to-end
4. **User Experience:** Delivering a complete working feature rather than partially functional components

All acceptance criteria for Story 0.12 were met as part of Story 0.11 implementation.

### File List

**Files Modified in Story 0.11 (covering Story 0.12 scope):**
- `apps/web/src/components/features/bookings/BookingFormModal.tsx` - Full form implementation
- `apps/web/src/components/features/bookings/BookingFormModal.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Added createBooking() method
- `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.test.ts` - API client tests

**No additional files created for Story 0.12** - all functionality already present from Story 0.11.

### Technical Observations

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive error handling with specific toast messages for each API error code

- Type-safe API client with OpenAPI-generated types ensures API contract compliance
- Accessibility practices: labeled inputs, proper dialog structure
- Loading states with button text change and input disabling

**Technical Debt (Low Priority):**
- localStorage auth token - documented TODO for Epic 2 auth context migration ([api-client.ts:81](apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts#L81))
- React act() warnings in tests - cosmetic only from Radix UI Dialog animations, all tests pass

**Future Enhancements:**
- Epic 2: React Hook Form + Zod validation (deferred per architecture decision)
- Epic 4: Materials URLs field activation

### Files Modified During Review
