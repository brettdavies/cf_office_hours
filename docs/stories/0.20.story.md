# Story 0.20: Enhanced Local Development Seed Data

## Status

Done

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** realistic availability slots and booking data for comprehensive local testing,
**so that** I can develop and test features with production-like scenarios without deploying to production.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Availability Slots for All Mentors:**
   - Each mentor has 3 availability blocks across upcoming 3 weeks
   - Week 1: Random date NOW() + random {1-7} days, random time 8am-8pm, random duration (15min, 30min, 60min)
   - Week 2: Random date NOW() + random {8-14} days, random time 8am-8pm, random duration (15min, 30min, 60min)
   - Week 3: Random date NOW() + random {15-21} days, random time 8am-8pm, random duration (15min, 30min, 60min)
   - SQL seed file uses dynamic date calculation (e.g., `NOW() + INTERVAL '5 days' + INTERVAL '9 hours'`)
   - Each availability block generates time slots (per existing availability schema)

2. **Booking Slots for Mentees:**
   - 50% of available slots have bookings
   - Bookings split: 50% status='pending', 50% status='confirmed'
   - Random mentee assigned to each booking (from ALL mentees in seed data)
   - Random meeting_goal text (from predefined templates: "Discuss fundraising strategy", "Get feedback on product roadmap", etc.)

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - Test: Verify availability blocks created (1200 blocks = 400 mentors × 3 blocks)
   - Test: Verify time slots generated (1200 slots)
   - Test: Verify bookings created (approximately 50% of slots booked)
   - Test: Verify booking status distribution (approximately 50% pending, 50% confirmed)

4. **Production Seed Files Updated:**
   - All changes applied to `supabase/seeds/production/*.sql` to match local seed behavior
   - Production seeds use same dynamic date logic for realistic test data in production environment

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

This story enhances Story 0.2 (SKEL-DB-002: Mock Data Seeding Script) by adding realistic availability and booking data for local development. The original seed script created users, taxonomy, and portfolio companies, but lacked availability slots and bookings needed for testing booking flows.

**Why This Matters:**
- Developers need realistic test data to work on booking features locally
- Without availability slots, mentees can't test browsing/booking flows
- Without existing bookings, dashboard and calendar features show empty states
- Dynamic date generation ensures test data is always "upcoming" (not expired)
- Separate availability and booking seed files allow independent re-seeding

**Story Boundaries:**
- ✅ Create seed data for availability blocks and bookings
- ✅ Update production seed files to match (same dynamic date logic)
- ✅ Fix user seed files for local development (ETL disabled for users)
- ✅ Separate availability and booking generation for clarity
- ❌ NO changes to database schema (already defined in migrations)
- ❌ NO changes to API or frontend (this is pure data seeding)
- ❌ NO production email updates (special emails not provided)

### Testing Results

**Seed Data Verification (Local - After QA Fix):**
```
Users: 400 mentors, 50 mentees, 2 coordinators
Availability: 1200 blocks (400 mentors × 3 weeks)
Time Slots: 5670 total (2835 available, 2835 booked)
Bookings: 2835 total (1420 pending, 1415 confirmed)
Booking percentage: 50.00% ✓
Average slots per block: 4.73 (1-3 hour blocks with 15/30/60 min slots)
```

All acceptance criteria met! ✅ QA issue resolved - availability blocks now create multi-slot windows.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD**

The implementation successfully delivers comprehensive seed data for local development with realistic availability blocks and bookings. The SQL code is well-structured, clearly commented, and properly idempotent. The developer correctly adapted the schema during implementation (migrating from separate date/time to timestamptz) and documented schema adjustments in completion notes.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent code organization with clear section headers
- ✅ Proper idempotency handling (DELETE vs TRUNCATE choice)
- ✅ Dynamic date generation ensures data is always "upcoming"
- ✅ Comprehensive verification queries for manual validation
- ✅ Production seeds mirror local seed logic (consistency)
- ✅ Well-documented file headers explaining usage and purpose
- ✅ Schema migration properly handled (timestamptz conversion)

**Critical Issue Identified:**

**BLOCKING DEFECT:** Availability blocks create only single-slot durations, not multi-slot blocks as intended.

**Location:** [supabase/seeds/07_seed_availability.sql:84](supabase/seeds/07_seed_availability.sql#L84)

**Problem:**
```sql
-- Current implementation (INCORRECT):
end_time = start_datetime + (INTERVAL '1 minute' * slot_duration_mins)
```

This creates availability blocks that are exactly 1 slot long (15min, 30min, or 60min). The AC states "3 availability blocks" but doesn't specify whether each block should contain multiple slots or single slots. The current implementation creates 1200 blocks × 1 slot each = 1200 slots, which matches the test results but represents minimal availability.

**Expected Behavior (Based on Real-World Usage):**
Availability blocks should represent multi-hour periods where mentors are available, subdivided into bookable slots:
- Example: Block from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM (2 hours) with 30min slots → generates 4 bookable slots
- Example: Block from 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (1 hour) with 15min slots → generates 4 bookable slots

**Recommended Fix:**
```sql
-- Option 1: Fixed 2-hour blocks
random_block_duration := 120; -- 2 hours = realistic availability window
end_time = start_datetime + (INTERVAL '1 minute' * random_block_duration)

-- Option 2: Variable block duration (1-3 hours)
random_block_hours := 1 + floor(random() * 3)::int; -- 1, 2, or 3 hours
end_time = start_datetime + (INTERVAL '1 hour' * random_block_hours)
```

This would generate:
- 1200 availability blocks (same)
- 4800-7200 time slots (4-6 slots per block on average)
- More realistic test data for booking flows

**Impact:** Low-Medium
- ✅ No production impact (seed data only)
- ✅ Tests still pass (AC criteria are technically met)
- ⚠️ Limited local dev experience (mentors appear to have minimal availability)
- ⚠️ Doesn't reflect production usage patterns

### Refactoring Performed

None. This is a seed data story with no application logic requiring refactoring.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ SQL code is clean, well-commented, follows PostgreSQL conventions
- **Project Structure:** ✓ Files placed in correct locations (supabase/seeds/, supabase/seeds/production/)
- **Testing Strategy:** ✓ No tests required for seed data; manual verification queries provided
- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - See "Critical Issue Identified" above

**AC Validation:**
1. ✓ **Availability Slots:** 1200 blocks created (400 mentors × 3 weeks) with dynamic dates, random times/durations
2. ✓ **Booking Slots:** 600 bookings (50% of slots), split 309 pending / 291 confirmed (~50/50)
3. ✓ **Test Coverage:** All verification queries successful, counts match expectations
4. ✓ **Production Seed Files:** Created and integrated into seed_all_production.sql

### Improvements Checklist

**Blocking Items:**
- [ ] **Fix availability block duration** - Current: 1 slot per block; Expected: Multi-slot blocks (1-3 hours)
  - Update [supabase/seeds/07_seed_availability.sql:84](supabase/seeds/07_seed_availability.sql#L84)
  - Rerun local verification to confirm slot counts increase proportionally

**Advisory Recommendations (Optional):**
- [ ] Consider adding comments explaining why DELETE is used instead of TRUNCATE (safer for cascading relationships)
- [ ] Consider extracting magic numbers to variables for clarity (e.g., `MENTORS_PER_SEED := 400`)
- [ ] Consider adding `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to time_slots insert (though unlikely to conflict, defensive)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security concerns for seed data scripts:
- ✅ No sensitive data (all example.com emails, fake names)
- ✅ No external inputs (static SQL)
- ✅ No RLS bypass attempts
- ✅ Proper soft delete field usage (deleted_by, not deleted_at for users)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

Seed scripts are well-optimized:
- ✅ Batch inserts within DO blocks (single transaction per entity type)
- ✅ Appropriate use of DELETE for idempotency (won't cause table bloat in dev)
- ✅ No N+1 query patterns
- ✅ Verification queries use indexed columns (deleted_at, created_at)

**Note:** With the recommended fix (multi-slot blocks), expect:
- Insert time: +30-60 seconds (4-6x more time slots)
- Seed size: Still manageable for local dev
- Consider TRUNCATE for time_slots/availability in production if re-seeding frequently

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC 1: Availability Slots for All Mentors**
- **Given:** 400 mentors exist in seed data
- **When:** Availability seed script executes
- **Then:** 1200 availability blocks created (3 per mentor) with dynamic dates, random times 8am-8pm, durations 15/30/60min
- **Validation:** ✓ SQL query confirms 1200 blocks
- **Coverage Gap:** ⚠️ Block duration logic creates single-slot blocks (see Critical Issue)

**AC 2: Booking Slots for Mentees**
- **Given:** Time slots exist from AC 1
- **When:** Booking seed script executes
- **Then:** 50% of slots booked, 50/50 status split, random mentees assigned, random goals
- **Validation:** ✓ 600 bookings (50%), 309 pending / 291 confirmed (50.8% / 49.2%)
- **Test Coverage:** ✓ Verified with SQL count queries

**AC 3: Test Coverage**
- **Given:** Seed scripts executed
- **When:** Verification queries run
- **Then:** Counts match expected values
- **Validation:** ✓ All verification queries in story Dev Notes match expected
- **Test Type:** Manual verification (appropriate for seed data)

**AC 4: Production Seed Files Updated**
- **Given:** Local seed logic finalized
- **When:** Production seeds created
- **Then:** Same logic, same dynamic dates, integrated into seed_all_production.sql
- **Validation:** ✓ Files created, orchestration file updated
- **Test Coverage:** ✓ File structure verified

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**NFR: Maintainability**
- **Status:** ✓ PASS
- **Evidence:** Clear comments, modular DO blocks, well-named variables, verification queries

**NFR: Reliability**
- **Status:** ✓ PASS
- **Evidence:** Idempotent DELETE approach, ON CONFLICT handling in user seeds, proper foreign key relationships

**NFR: Testability**
- **Status:** ✓ PASS
- **Evidence:** Verification queries embedded in seed files, deterministic counts, reproducible results

**NFR: Performance (Seed Execution Time)**
- **Status:** ✓ PASS
- **Evidence:** Batch operations, no observable performance issues during testing

### Files Modified During Review

None. No code changes made during QA review.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → [docs/qa/gates/0.20-enhanced-local-development-seed-data.yml](docs/qa/gates/0.20-enhanced-local-development-seed-data.yml)

**Decision Rationale:**
Single-slot availability blocks reduce usefulness of test data. While ACs are technically met (1200 blocks exist), the implementation doesn't create realistic multi-slot booking scenarios. Recommend fixing block duration logic before marking complete.

**Full assessment details:** See gate file for risk profile, quality score, and detailed recommendations.

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Required** - Address blocking item before marking Done:
1. Fix availability block duration to create multi-slot blocks (1-3 hours)
2. Rerun verification to confirm increased slot counts
3. Update story Dev Notes with new slot counts if needed

**Estimated fix time:** 15-30 minutes

**Note:** Story owner decides final status. This is an advisory recommendation based on test architecture review.
