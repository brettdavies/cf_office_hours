# Story 0.14: Basic Email Notifications

## Status

Done

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to receive email confirmation when a booking is created,
**so that** I have a record of my upcoming meeting and the other participant is notified.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Email Sent on Booking Creation**: When a booking is created, send email to both mentor and mentee
2. **Email Content**: Email includes meeting details (date, time, location, goal), other participant name
3. **Supabase Email**: Uses Supabase built-in email service (simple text template)
4. **No Reminders**: Reminder emails are not implemented yet (added in Epic 4)

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

**Story 0.11** implemented the booking creation API which will trigger these notifications. The booking service creates bookings in the `bookings` table with mentor and mentee user details.

**Story 0.13** implemented the My Bookings dashboard where users can view their bookings after receiving the email confirmation.

### Tech Stack for Email Notifications

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3.3]

**Email Notification Strategy:**
- **Supabase Auth Native Email** for MVP
- Supabase Auth includes built-in transactional email for:
  - Magic link authentication
  - Password resets
  - Email confirmations
- **For custom notifications** (booking confirmations): Start with Supabase Auth's native email using simple text templates
- No external email service (SendGrid) needed for Epic 0

### Backend Architecture

[Source: architecture/8-backend-architecture.md#8.1]

**Service Layer Pattern:**
- Create `NotificationService` in `apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts`
- Follow layered architecture: Routes → Services → External Providers
- Use dependency injection for Supabase client

**Notification Service Structure:**
```typescript
// apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts
import { SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Booking } from '@shared/types/api.generated';

export class NotificationService {
  constructor(private supabase: SupabaseClient) {}

  async sendBookingConfirmationEmail(
    booking: Booking,
    mentorEmail: string,
    menteeEmail: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Send email to mentor
    // Send email to mentee
  }
}
```

### Supabase Email Integration

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Using Supabase Auth for Custom Emails:**

Supabase doesn't have a direct "send custom email" API in the way SendGrid does. For MVP, we have two options:

**Option 1 (Recommended for MVP):** Simple console logging + email placeholder
- Log email content to console/debug log
- Add TODO comment for production email integration
- Allows testing booking flow without email infrastructure
- Can upgrade to SendGrid or Supabase Edge Functions later

**Option 2:** Use Supabase Edge Functions to send emails via SMTP
- Create Supabase Edge Function that accepts email parameters
- Use nodemailer or similar within Edge Function
- More complex for MVP, deferred to Epic 4

**For Story 0.14 (MVP):** Use Option 1 - console logging with structured email content

### Email Content Structure

**Email Template (Plain Text):**
```
Subject: Meeting Confirmed with [Other Participant Name]

Hi [Recipient Name],

Your meeting has been confirmed!

Meeting Details:
- Date: [Day, Month DD, YYYY]
- Time: [HH:MM AM/PM - HH:MM AM/PM] (your timezone)
- Location: [Location or "Online"]
- Participant: [Other Participant Name]

Meeting Goal:
[Meeting Goal Text]

You can view your upcoming meetings at: [Dashboard URL]

```

### Date/Time Formatting

[Source: architecture/14-coding-standards.md]

Use `date-fns` for formatting timestamps:
```typescript
import { format } from 'date-fns';

const formattedDate = format(new Date(booking.time_slot.start_time), 'EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy');
const formattedTime = format(new Date(booking.time_slot.start_time), 'h:mm a');
```

All timestamps from database are UTC ISO 8601 strings. Format for display in email.

### Error Handling

[Source: architecture/14-coding-standards.md#14.10]

**Email Sending Should Not Block Booking:**
- Wrap email sending in try-catch
- Log errors but don't throw
- Booking should succeed even if email fails
- Example:
```typescript
try {
  await notificationService.sendBookingConfirmationEmail(booking, mentorEmail, menteeEmail);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to send booking confirmation email:', error);
  // Continue - booking already created successfully
}
```

### File Size Standards

[Source: architecture/14-coding-standards.md#14.3]

- Keep `notification.service.ts` under 200 lines
- If email templates grow, extract to separate `lib/email-templates.ts`

---

## Dev Notes - Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/13-testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Service tests: Co-located with service files using `.test.ts` suffix
  - `apps/api/src/services/notification.service.test.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/services/booking.service.test.ts` (update existing)

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Unit/Integration:** Vitest
- **Assertions:** Built-in Vitest matchers

**Test Patterns to Follow:**

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from 'vitest';
import { NotificationService } from './notification.service';

describe('NotificationService', () => {
  let service: NotificationService;
  let mockSupabase: any;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup before each test
    mockSupabase = {
      // Mock Supabase client methods
    };
    service = new NotificationService(mockSupabase);
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should send confirmation email to both mentor and mentee', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const booking = createMockBooking();
    const mentorEmail = 'mentor@example.com';
    const menteeEmail = 'mentee@example.com';

    // Act
    await service.sendBookingConfirmationEmail(booking, mentorEmail, menteeEmail);

    // Assert
    // Verify email sending was called twice
  });
});
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests for NotificationService methods
- Test email content formatting
- Test error handling (email send failure)
- Integration test: booking creation triggers emails
- Verify email sending failure doesn't block booking success

**Specific Test Cases Required:**

**notification.service.test.ts:**
- Sends email to mentor with correct content
- Sends email to mentee with correct content
- Formats date/time correctly in email
- Includes all required booking details
- Handles email sending errors gracefully

**booking.service.test.ts (update existing):**
- Creates booking and sends confirmation emails
- Booking succeeds even if email fails
- Both mentor and mentee receive emails

### Technical Debt Identified

**Priority: LOW** (No blockers, minor future enhancements)

1. **~~Dashboard URL Hardcoded~~** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Original Issue:** Dashboard URL was hardcoded to production
   - **Impact:** Prevented local testing (emails always pointed to production)
   - **Fix Applied:** Extracted to `DASHBOARD_URL` environment variable with production default
   - **Resolution:** NotificationService now accepts optional `dashboardUrl` parameter, defaults to production URL
   - **Testing:** Added 2 new tests verifying custom and default URL behavior (116 total tests passing)
   - **Files Modified:**
     - [apps/api/src/types/bindings.ts](apps/api/src/types/bindings.ts) - Added DASHBOARD_URL optional env var
     - [apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts](apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts) - Constructor accepts dashboardUrl parameter
     - [apps/api/src/services/booking.service.ts](apps/api/src/services/booking.service.ts) - Passes env.DASHBOARD_URL to NotificationService
     - [apps/api/src/services/notification.service.test.ts](apps/api/src/services/notification.service.test.ts) - Added tests for URL configuration

2. **Timezone Label** (Low Priority)
   - **Location:** [notification.service.ts:134](apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts#L134)
   - **Impact:** Minor - email says "(UTC)" which may confuse users expecting local time
   - **Recommendation:** Consider user timezone preferences in future epic
   - **Owner:** dev (Future epic when adding timezone support)

### Files Modified During Review

**4 files modified** to address hardcoded dashboard URL issue:

1. **apps/api/src/types/bindings.ts** - Added `DASHBOARD_URL?: string` to Env interface
2. **apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts** - Added constructor parameter for dashboard URL with production default
3. **apps/api/src/services/booking.service.ts** - Pass env.DASHBOARD_URL to NotificationService constructor
4. **apps/api/src/services/notification.service.test.ts** - Added 2 tests for custom and default URL configuration

### Gate Status
