# Story 0.16.1: Manual Testing Results

**Story**: Manual Pre-Deployment Testing & Logging Enhancement
**Tester**: Brett (Human Engineer) + Claude (Agent Engineer)
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Test Checklist**: [0.16.1-manual-test-checklist.md](./0.16.1-manual-test-checklist.md)

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ☐ Ready for Deployment  ☐ Needs BLOCKER Fixes  ☑ Needs Additional Work

**Test Results**:
- Total Tests: 28 (24 original + 4 email whitelist validation)
- Passed: 4 (Tests 25-28: Email whitelist validation)
- Failed: 0
- Blocked: 24 (Tests 1-24: Awaiting human testing)

**Key Findings**:
- Email whitelist validation fully implemented and tested
- All 4 authentication scenarios passing (new signup, blocked signup, existing login, removed user)
- Security hardening complete: no fallback behavior on failed API calls
- Database view approach simplified whitelist validation from 3 queries to 1

## Email Whitelist Validation Tests (Completed)

### Test 25: New Whitelisted User Signup - ✅ PASSED
- **Test Case**: Test #25 - New Whitelisted User Signup
- **Steps Executed**:
  1. Added `amanda.johnson@mentee.example.com` to `raw_mentees` table
  2. Verified email exists in `email_whitelist` view
  3. Sent magic link via login page
  4. Clicked magic link from Inbucket mailbox
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Magic link sent successfully
  - User created in auth.users and public.users with correct role
  - User can access dashboard
  - API middleware allows access (200 responses)
- **Actual Behavior**: All expectations met
  - User created with `id: efee4d5b-962e-4973-8f89-dfc61906c01a`
  - Role correctly set to `mentee` from whitelist
  - Console logs showed: `[PROFILE] User profile loaded successfully { userId, role: "mentee" }`
  - Multiple 200 responses from `/v1/users/me` endpoint
- **Verdict**: ✅ PASS

---

### Test 26: Non-Whitelisted User Blocked - ✅ PASSED (Better than expected!)
- **Test Case**: Test #26 - Non-Whitelisted User Blocked
- **Steps Executed**:
  1. Attempted signup with `hacker@example.com` (not in any raw tables)
  2. Verified email NOT in `email_whitelist` view
  3. Attempted to send magic link
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Error message shown (acceptable if magic link sent but can't be used)
- **Actual Behavior**: Better than expected!
  - Magic link was NOT sent (blocked at Supabase Auth level)
  - Database trigger `handle_new_user` raised exception before user creation
  - No auth.users record created
  - No public.users record created
- **Verdict**: ✅ PASS (exceeded expectations - blocked before magic link sent)

---

### Test 27: Existing Whitelisted User Login - ✅ PASSED
- **Test Case**: Test #27 - Existing Whitelisted User Login
- **Steps Executed**:
  1. Used existing `amanda.johnson@mentee.example.com` user
  2. Sent magic link
  3. Clicked magic link from Inbucket
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Magic link sent
  - User can authenticate and access dashboard
  - API middleware validates whitelist (200 responses)
- **Actual Behavior**: All expectations met
  - Redirected to `/dashboard` successfully
  - Console logs showed session establishment
  - API middleware returned 200 for all requests
- **Verdict**: ✅ PASS

---

### Test 28: User Removed from Whitelist - ✅ PASSED
- **Test Case**: Test #28 - User Removed from Whitelist (Active Session)
- **Steps Executed**:
  1. User logged in with active session
  2. Removed `amanda.johnson@mentee.example.com` from `raw_mentees`
  3. Verified removal from `email_whitelist` view
  4. User clicked "Profile" navigation button
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - API returns 403 Forbidden
  - Console log: `[AUTH] API call failed, signing out`
  - User immediately signed out
  - Redirected to login page
  - No fallback to default role
- **Actual Behavior**: All expectations met
  - API returned 403 for `/v1/users/me` request
  - Console logged: `[AUTH] API call failed, signing out { status: 403 }`
  - User signed out (session cleared)
  - Redirect to login occurred (slight UI delay due to React async rendering, but security enforced)
- **Verdict**: ✅ PASS

## BLOCKER Gaps

> **Definition**: Issues that prevent deployment or break critical user flows. These MUST be fixed before deploying.

None identified during email whitelist validation testing.

---

## IMPORTANT Gaps

> **Definition**: Major issues but workaround exists or non-critical path. Should be fixed soon but don't block deployment.

## Console Logging Quality

**Overall Assessment**: ☑ Excellent  ☐ Good  ☐ Needs Improvement

**Observations**:
- Auth flow logging: Excellent - clear categories `[AUTH]`, `[PROFILE]`, detailed context objects
- Booking flow logging: Not yet tested (awaiting Tests 1-24)
- Availability flow logging: Not yet tested (awaiting Tests 1-24)
- API request logging: Not yet tested (awaiting Tests 1-24)

**Issues with Logging**:
- None identified in email whitelist validation tests

---

## Additional Notes

**Positive Observations**:
- Email whitelist implementation exceeded expectations (Test 26 blocked signup before magic link sent)
- Database view approach simplified codebase significantly
- Security hardening (no fallback behavior) working correctly
- All automated tests passing (118 API tests, TypeScript compilation)

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Minor UI delay when signing out removed users (not a security issue, but could be smoother)
- Remaining Tests 1-24 still need to be executed by human tester

**Testing Environment Details**:
- Browser: Chrome with DevTools MCP
- OS: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
- Node Version: (as per project)
- Supabase Instance: Local (127.0.0.1:54322)

## Recommendations

**Deployment Decision**:
- ☐ **APPROVE**: All BLOCKERs resolved, safe to deploy
- ☐ **CONDITIONAL APPROVE**: Deploy after fixing listed BLOCKERs
- ☑ **IN PROGRESS**: Email whitelist validation complete, remaining tests needed

**Next Steps**:
1. Continue with manual testing of Tests 1-24 (auth flow, profiles, bookings, availability)
2. Document any gaps found in BLOCKER/IMPORTANT/MINOR sections
3. Fix any BLOCKERs identified
4. Re-test and make final deployment decision
