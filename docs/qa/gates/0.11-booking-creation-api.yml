nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "requireAuth middleware properly applied. Atomic database transactions prevent race conditions. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection. User ID extracted from JWT, not request body."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single RPC call for atomic operation minimizes overhead. Indexed UUID lookups. Minimal transaction lock time. No N+1 queries."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes. Atomic transactions ensure data consistency. No partial bookings possible. Proper error propagation through all layers."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. Centralized mock fixtures throughout. Self-documenting code with JSDoc comments. Follows established patterns from previous stories."

    outcome: "âœ… RESOLVED - Validation comprehensively tested"

  test_002_resolution:
    summary: "Fixed OpenAPI spec generation test failure"
    details:
      - "Root cause: Booking schemas not exported from shared package index"
