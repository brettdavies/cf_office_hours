# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authorization header properly included in API requests. Token retrieved from localStorage (documented as TODO for auth context migration)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client-side validation before API call minimizes unnecessary requests. Loading states prevent duplicate submissions."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for 400, 401, 403, 404, 409 status codes with user-friendly toast messages."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, proper TypeScript typing, centralized mock factories used in tests. JSDoc documentation present."
  testability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "56 tests with 100% AC coverage. Centralized mock factories (bookings.ts, slots.ts). Well-structured test organization."

# Observations
observations:
  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive test coverage (24 component + 32 API client tests)"
    - "Proper use of centralized mock factories (Story 0.9 pattern)"
    - "Clean separation: UI component + API client abstraction"
    - "Excellent error handling with specific toast messages for each error code"
    - "Loading states prevent duplicate submissions"
    - "Form reset on modal close"
    - "Accessibility: labeled inputs, proper dialog structure"
  technical_debt:
    - "localStorage auth token (documented TODO for auth context migration)"
    - "React act() warnings in tests (Radix UI Dialog animation timing - cosmetic only, tests pass)"
  future_enhancements:
    - "Epic 4: Materials URLs field (currently disabled placeholder)"
    - "Epic 2: React Hook Form + Zod validation (deferred per architecture)"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Migrate auth token from localStorage to React Context (documented TODO in api-client.ts:81)"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts:81"]

    - action: "Wrap async state updates in act() to eliminate test warnings"

      severity: "low"
      note: "Cosmetic only - all tests pass, warnings from Radix UI Dialog animations"

# Summary
summary: |
  Story 0.12 represents documentation of functionality fully implemented in Story 0.11.

  The implementation demonstrates EXCELLENT engineering practices:
  - 100% acceptance criteria coverage with 56 comprehensive tests
  - Proper use of centralized mock factories (Section 14.11.2 compliance)
  - Type-safe API client with OpenAPI-generated types
  - Comprehensive error handling for all expected status codes
  - Clean component architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Good accessibility practices (labeled inputs, semantic HTML)

  No blocking issues identified. Minor technical debt items are documented for future
  epics (auth context migration, React Hook Form).

  RECOMMENDATION: Mark story as DONE and proceed to Story 0.13 (My Bookings Dashboard).
