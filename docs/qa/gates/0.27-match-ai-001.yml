  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'API key management secure, but PII data sent to third-party (OpenAI) requires privacy review. Timeout protection added during QA.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Rate limiting strategy sound (5/chunk, 500ms delay). 10-second timeout added during QA to prevent hung connections. Cost-optimized with gpt-4o-mini.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation on failures (returns 0 score). Timeout protection prevents indefinite waiting. No retry logic, but acceptable for MVP.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent JSDoc documentation, centralized test fixtures (Section 14.11.2 compliant), strong type safety, clean architecture.'
