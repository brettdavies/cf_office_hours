  notes: |
    - Comprehensive unit test coverage for all layout components
    - Role-based navigation properly tested for all user types (mentee, mentor, coordinator)
    - Integration tests verify navigation flow and active link highlighting
    - Type-safe mock user factory (createMockUser) eliminates test brittleness
    - All tests follow consistent patterns using test-utils helpers

code_quality_improvements:
  refactoring_performed:
    - file: 'apps/web/src/test/test-utils.tsx'
      change: 'Added createMockUser factory function'
      reason: 'Tests were creating incomplete user objects causing type errors'
      impact: 'All tests now use properly typed UserWithProfile objects. Eliminates future type errors.'

    - file: 'apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts'
      change: 'Fixed UserWithProfile construction to match API schema'
      reason: 'Hook was adding non-existent fields (name, avatar_url at root) instead of using nested profile object'
      impact: 'Type-safe user data flow from API to components. Proper fallback handling.'

    - file: 'apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.test.ts'
      change: 'Updated test expectations to match new UserWithProfile structure'
      reason: 'Tests were asserting on old incomplete structure'
      impact: 'Tests now verify correct UserWithProfile shape with profile object.'

    - file: 'apps/web/src/components/layouts/UserMenu.tsx'
      change: 'Removed avatar_url reference (user.avatar_url -> undefined)'
      reason: 'Avatar URL not in UserWithProfile schema; should come from profile.avatar_url if needed'
      impact: 'Component now type-safe. Avatar functionality ready for future profile enhancement.'

    - file: 'Multiple test files'
      change: 'Updated all component tests to use createMockUser helper'
      reason: 'Consistency and type safety across test suite'
      impact: 'Eliminated 15+ TypeScript errors. Tests are maintainable and resilient to schema changes.'

architecture_assessment:
  patterns: 'Excellent use of composition with Header -> Navigation + UserMenu + MobileMenu'
  concerns: []
  strengths:
    - 'Clean separation: AppLayout (structure) -> Header (composition) -> Navigation/UserMenu (features)'
    - 'Proper use of React Router Outlet pattern for nested routes'
    - 'Responsive design with mobile-first approach using Tailwind breakpoints'
    - 'Consistent styling with Shadcn/ui components (Avatar, Dropdown, Sheet)'
    - 'Role-based rendering logic centralized in Navigation/MobileMenu components'
