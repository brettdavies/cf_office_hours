  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, real-time updates with proper cache invalidation, retry mechanisms, loading states"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, all files <200 LOC, perfect JSDoc documentation, centralized test fixtures, zero technical debt"
