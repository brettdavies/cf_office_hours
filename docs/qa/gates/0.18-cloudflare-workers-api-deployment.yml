# Story-specific notes
notes: |
  This is a deployment story (Story 0.18) focused on infrastructure provisioning,
  not feature development. Quality assessment prioritizes operational readiness,
  security configuration, and deployment verification over code changes.

  Key achievements:
  - Production API accessible globally via Cloudflare edge network
  - Zero downtime deployment process established
  - All secrets properly externalized (not in code/git)
  - Comprehensive deployment documentation created
  - Rollback procedures documented and tested
  - Live production verification completed successfully

  The story represents excellent execution of deployment best practices with
  clear documentation and operational procedures. Security gaps identified are
  acceptable for Epic 0 MVP scope and properly tracked for Epic 1.
