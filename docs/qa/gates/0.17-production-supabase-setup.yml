# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 0.17 successfully establishes production Supabase infrastructure with all 7 acceptance criteria met, excellent documentation, and all critical issues resolved.

  RESOLVED ISSUES:
  âœ… SEC-001 (HIGH): Production seed files with PII are now properly git-ignored (.gitignore lines 67-69)
  âœ… REL-001 (MEDIUM): Seed scripts now use safe idempotent upsert logic with UNIQUE constraints on email columns

  MONITORING:
  ðŸ”µ OPS-001 (LOW): Connection pooler intermittency documented with adequate workaround (use direct connection port 5432)

  All NFRs validated as PASS:
  - Security: RLS policies verified, credentials secured, PII protection in place
  - Performance: No critical performance issues
  - Reliability: Idempotent seed scripts, comprehensive runbook, clear rollback procedures
  - Maintainability: Excellent documentation quality

  Production infrastructure is ready for Stories 0.18-0.19 deployment.

  Gate Status: PASS âœ…
  Quality Score: 95/100
  Recommended Status: Approved for "Done"
