# Review notes
notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation of the availability management feature. The code demonstrates:

  1. **Strong Architecture**: Clear separation between repository (data access), service (business logic),
     and route (HTTP) layers. Each layer has well-defined responsibilities.

  2. **Comprehensive Testing**: 60 tests across all layers provide excellent coverage of both happy
     paths and error scenarios. Tests are well-structured following AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert).

  3. **Type Safety**: Excellent use of Zod for runtime validation combined with TypeScript for
     compile-time safety. All types properly inferred from schemas.

  4. **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting with clear names, plus comprehensive JSDoc comments
     explaining intent and usage.

  5. **Error Handling**: Consistent use of AppError class with proper status codes and error messages.
     No information leakage in error responses.

  **Minor Issues Found and Resolved**:
  - TypeScript export resolution required building the shared package to generate .d.ts files
  - Context type used generic `string` for role instead of specific union type
  - Test assertions needed type annotations for TypeScript strict mode

  All issues were resolved during the review process. The code is production-ready.
