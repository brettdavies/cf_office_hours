nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - RLS policy correctly restricts access to coordinators only
      - No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies (write-only through backend)
      - Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
      - No sensitive data exposure risk
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - All 4 required indexes created for optimal query performance
      - Composite index (user_id, match_score DESC) enables efficient sorting
      - Single-column indexes support filtering operations
      - Schema design supports instant retrieval pattern (<100ms target)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ON DELETE CASCADE prevents orphaned cache entries
      - CHECK constraints enforce data integrity (score 0-100, no self-matches)
      - UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate cache entries
      - NOT NULL constraints on all critical fields
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Excellent JSDoc documentation with @logging specifications
      - Clear separation of concerns (interface vs implementation)
      - Architecture principles documented in code comments
      - Migration follows naming conventions
      - TypeScript interface matches database schema precisely

  future:
    - action: "Consider adding database trigger for updated_at auto-update"
      refs: ["supabase/migrations/20251007183502_create_user_match_cache.sql:29"]
      severity: low
      note: "Currently updated_at defaults to now() but won't auto-update on row changes. Not critical since cache entries are typically deleted/recreated rather than updated."
