  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API client handles auth properly, error responses sanitized, no sensitive data exposed. localStorage usage appropriate for Epic 0"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zero runtime overhead (compile-time types only), native fetch (minimal bundle), generic inference has no runtime cost"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type safety prevents API misuse, custom error handling, comprehensive test coverage"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single source of truth eliminates type drift, auto-generated types reduce maintenance, excellent documentation"
