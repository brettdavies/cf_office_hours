      priority: low
      rationale: "Make pattern officially documented for onboarding"
    - action: "Consider fixture factory generator tool for new domains"

      priority: low
      rationale: "Could reduce boilerplate when creating new fixture files"

final_assessment: |
  This test infrastructure work demonstrates exemplary engineering practices:

  1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear organization with one fixture file per domain
  2. **Factory Pattern**: Flexible factories with sensible defaults and partial overrides
  3. **Type Safety**: Leverages OpenAPI-generated types for schema correctness
  4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc guides proper usage
  5. **Consistency**: Pattern applied across 5 domains (user, matching, slots, bookings, availability)
  6. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth reduces fragility
  7. **Developer Experience**: Clear guidance and examples reduce cognitive load

  The implementation of createMockUserProfile() and createMockUseCurrentUserResult()
  provides a solid foundation for test data management. The pattern is:
  - Easy to understand and use
  - Easy to extend for new scenarios
  - Easy to maintain when schemas change
  - Easy to replicate for new domains

  All acceptance criteria fully met. No regressions introduced (289 tests passing).
  The fixture pattern is production-ready and should be used as reference for
  future fixture implementations.

  **GATE: PASS** - Excellent test infrastructure that improves maintainability.
