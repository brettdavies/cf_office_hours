    - action: "Consider extracting date formatting utilities to shared package for potential backend reuse"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/lib/date-utils.ts"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Current implementation is excellent; this is purely a DRY optimization"
    - action: "Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff for transient API failures"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Current error handling is solid; retry would improve UX for flaky networks"
    - action: "Consider caching API responses for repeat requests within short time window"
      refs: ["apps/web/src/components/features/bookings/SlotPickerList.tsx"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Performance is already excellent; caching could reduce backend load"
