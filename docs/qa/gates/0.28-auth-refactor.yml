      - Clear migration patterns documented
      - Self-documenting code structure

architecture_assessment:
  pattern: "Two-Layer Authentication Architecture"
  layers:
    - name: "AuthContext (Session Layer)"
      responsibility: "Supabase session management, auth state, single listener"
      quality: "Excellent - lightweight, focused, single source of truth"
    - name: "useCurrentUser (Profile Layer)"
      responsibility: "User profile data via React Query with caching"
      quality: "Excellent - proper React Query patterns, deduplication, cache config"
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation eliminates duplicate listeners"
    - "React Query provides automatic deduplication and caching"
    - "Three-level deduplication strategy (Context + Query + API client)"
    - "Proper dependency injection (QueryClient invalidation)"
    - "Testability via provider pattern and mocking"
  considerations:
    - "Console logging should be environment-aware for production"
    - "Request deduplication map is self-cleaning (acceptable)"

final_assessment: |
  This is an exemplary refactoring that demonstrates:

  1. **Problem Analysis**: Thorough investigation using HAR files to identify root cause
  2. **Solution Design**: Well-architected two-layer approach (session vs profile)
  3. **Implementation Quality**: Clean code, proper patterns, comprehensive testing
  4. **Documentation**: Excellent educational content for future developers
  5. **Performance Impact**: Measurable 70-80% reduction in API calls
  6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend

  The implementation successfully eliminates duplicate API calls through three
  complementary strategies:
  - AuthContext provides single source of truth for session
  - React Query deduplicates profile fetches via query keys
  - API client deduplicates concurrent requests via promise caching

  All acceptance criteria are fully met. Test coverage is comprehensive (289 passing
  tests). The code follows all architectural standards and coding conventions.

  **GATE: PASS** - Ready for production deployment.

  Minor future enhancements suggested around logging and monitoring, but these are
  non-blocking improvements that can be addressed in subsequent iterations.
