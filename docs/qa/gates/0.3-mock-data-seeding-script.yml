  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All data anonymized with [Product]/[Technology Company] placeholders. Proper SQL escaping. Zero PII exposure risk."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Individual INSERT statements appropriate for complex data. One-time seed operation with negligible performance impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Idempotency correctly implemented via TRUNCATE pattern. Testable via repeated 'supabase db reset'."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent and now fully accurate documentation. Clean SQL formatting. Clear separation of migrations and seeds. Individual INSERT statements more maintainable than multi-value for complex data."
