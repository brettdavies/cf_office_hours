# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No authentication/authorization changes. No API endpoints. localStorage usage safe for non-sensitive favorites. No XSS risks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Production build succeeds (2.11s). Bundle size noted but acceptable for coordinator-only page (106.51 KB gzipped). Memoized callbacks, efficient rendering."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in useFavoriteMetrics. Graceful localStorage degradation. Factory pattern handles unknown types safely."
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "DRY compliance with 88% code reduction (573â†’67 lines). Factory pattern + composition. Single source of truth config. 68 tests ensure refactoring safety."

# Compliance verification
compliance:
  coding_standards: PASS
  project_structure: PASS
  testing_strategy: EXCEEDS
  acceptance_criteria: PASS
  details:
    - "All file sizes under 200 lines (except config data file, justified)"
    - "Proper naming conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks)"
    - "Centralized test fixtures (Coding Standard 14.11.2)"
    - "JSDoc comments on all public functions"
    - "All 14 acceptance criteria met (including 2 bonus features)"

# Audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-10-16T21:50:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    note: "Initial review - exceptional implementation with proactive refactoring"
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Additional notes
notes: |
  This story represents exemplary software craftsmanship. The developer not only met all 14 acceptance
  criteria (including both bonus features AC 13-14), but went significantly beyond requirements by:

  1. Proactively refactoring from 13 ad-hoc components to a clean 3-layer architecture
  2. Eliminating 825+ lines of code duplication post-implementation
  3. Reducing main page from 573 lines to 67 lines (88% reduction)
  4. Implementing factory pattern with discriminated unions for type safety
  5. Creating centralized test fixtures following Coding Standard 14.11.2
  6. Achieving 68 tests with 100% passing rate

  The refactoring demonstrates strong understanding of SOLID principles, DRY/ACID/STAR coding standards,
  and composition over inheritance patterns. This is exactly the kind of quality improvement we want to see.

  Minor bundle size concern (359 KB) is acceptable for MVP given this is a coordinator-only page with
  small user base. Future optimization path identified but not blocking.

  Production-ready. Outstanding work! ðŸŽ‰
