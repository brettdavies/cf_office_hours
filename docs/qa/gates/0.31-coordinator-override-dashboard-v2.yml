# Waived Issues
waived_issues:
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "CoordinatorOverridesPage is 890 lines (target <200)"
    waiver_reason: "Non-blocking for production. 4 reusable components already extracted (OverridesSortingControl, OverridesBulkActionsToolbar, OverridesKeyboardShortcuts, OverridesFilterPanel). Further extraction can be done in follow-up story."
    suggested_action: "Extract remaining inline UI into separate components in future refactoring story"

# Risk Summary

    low: 1       # File size (waived as non-blocking)
  highest:
    score: 2
    category: "Architecture"
    rationale: "Large component file (890 lines) but mitigated by extracting 4 reusable components. Non-blocking for production."

    notes: "Excellent security: RLS policies enforced, coordinator-only authorization, proper foreign key constraints, no SQL injection vulnerabilities, authentication required on all routes"

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "EXCELLENT - All critical performance issues resolved: N+1 eliminated (95% query reduction), useCallback prevents unnecessary re-renders, useEffect properly used for side effects. Backend: 41→2 queries, ~800ms→~150ms (81% improvement). Frontend: keyboard listener stable, no stale closures."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling: AppError wrapping for consistency, proper loading states, graceful degradation for missing data (match scores, avatars), React Query automatic retry logic. 13 tests covering critical paths including edge cases."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "EXCELLENT - High code quality with comprehensive JSDoc documentation, strong type safety, reusable components extracted (4 new), shared constants follow DRY principle, comprehensive test coverage (13 tests), consistent error handling."

# Quality Score
