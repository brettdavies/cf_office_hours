  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RLS policies appropriate for Epic 0 scope. All 5 tables have RLS enabled with 11 policies. Public read access correctly aligned with discovery requirements (FR15, FR29). Coordinator policies deferred to Epic 1 as documented."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Index strategy well-designed. Composite indexes on (mentor_id, start_time) enable efficient range queries. Estimated query time <50ms for 60k rows (well within NFR3: <1 second)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ RESOLVED: FK constraint on time_slots.booking_id now enforces referential integrity. All 8 FK constraints in place. ON DELETE SET NULL prevents orphaned references."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with Epic scope comments and QA fix references. Clear schema evolution path. Rollback instructions included. Migration follows project structure conventions."

# Final recommendation
final_recommendation: |
  ✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**
  
  Story 1.1 demonstrates EXCELLENT database schema design with comprehensive data integrity
  enforcement and robust validation layer. The developer has successfully addressed all QA
  concerns identified in the initial review:
  
  **Resolved Issues:**
  - DATA-001: FK constraint on time_slots.booking_id now enforces referential integrity ✅
  - VALID-001: CHECK constraints provide database-level time/date validation ✅
  
  **Schema Quality Summary:**
  - 5 tables with comprehensive field documentation
  - 8 FK constraints ensuring complete referential integrity
  - 4 CHECK constraints for time/date validation
  - 13 indexes optimized for query patterns
  - 11 RLS policies with appropriate Epic 0 scope
  - Clear evolution path documented for Epic 1+ features
  
  **Status:** Story is production-ready and EXCEEDS Epic 0 requirements. The schema provides
  a solid foundation for the Walking Skeleton with robust data integrity guarantees and
  excellent maintainability.
  
  **Recommendation:** Mark story as DONE and proceed to next Epic 0 story.
