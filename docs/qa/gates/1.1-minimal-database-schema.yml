      EXCELLENT RLS implementation - 27 policies across 9 tables verified in database:
      - Public read access for discovery tables (portfolio_companies, user_profiles, user_urls, taxonomy, entity_tags, availability, time_slots)
      - User-owned CRUD for personal data (users, user_profiles, user_urls, entity_tags for own tags, availability for mentors, bookings for participants)
      - Coordinator override policies on 8 tables (portfolio_companies, user_profiles, taxonomy, entity_tags, availability, time_slots, bookings) for admin capabilities
      - Soft delete WHERE clauses in policies (entity_tags: deleted_at IS NULL)
      - Proper FK constraints prevent unauthorized data access
      - Audit columns (created_by, updated_by, deleted_by) support compliance tracking and future security audits
      NO security vulnerabilities detected.

      **RLS Policy Tests (15 tests, 100% passing):**
      - Public read access verified for 7 tables
      - Insert restrictions verified (anonymous users blocked)
      - Update restrictions verified (RLS silently filters unauthorized rows)
      - Delete restrictions verified
      - Soft delete filtering verified (entity_tags WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Proper indexing strategy verified - 20+ indexes on:
      - Foreign keys: mentor_id, user_id, portfolio_company_id, taxonomy_id, availability_id, time_slot_id
      - Common query patterns: (mentor_id, start_time) composite, is_booked flag, status enum
      - Unique constraints with indexes: email, airtable_record_id, user_id, category/value composite, time_slot_id
      - Taxonomy composite index: (category, is_approved, value) for filtered searches
      Auto-update triggers for updated_at timestamps prevent stale data.
      Soft delete via deleted_at enables index optimization (partial indexes, WHERE deleted_at IS NULL).

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Schema design is ROBUST with proper constraints verified in database:
      - 31 total constraints (11 CHECK, 6 UNIQUE, 14 FOREIGN KEY)
      - CHECK constraints enforce enums and business rules (role, avatar_source_type, url_type, category, source, entity_type, slot_duration_minutes, date/time ranges, status, meeting_time_range)
      - FK constraints with appropriate cascades (CASCADE for owned data, SET NULL for references, RESTRICT for bookings)
      - Partial UNIQUE index on entity_tags correctly handles soft delete edge case

      **Test Coverage VALIDATES Reliability:**
      - 37 tests, 100% passing
      - Schema validation tests (14 tests): All 9 tables verified with correct column structure
      - Constraint tests (8 tests): UNIQUE, CHECK, FK constraints enforced
      - RLS policy tests (15 tests): Access control correctly implemented
      - No schema drift detected (supabase db diff clean)

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      EXCELLENT documentation and code quality:
      - 25+ table and column COMMENT ON statements explain purpose, constraints, polymorphic patterns
      - Clear migration file structure with section headers (trigger function, tables, FK constraints, RLS policies)
      - Comprehensive inline documentation for v2.4 changes
      - Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for database objects)
      - Well-organized schema following v2.4 data model architecture
      - Dev notes provide detailed context for each table and design decision
      - Test files include documentation headers with version tracking
      Migration file is 670 lines (exceeds coding standard target of <200) but acceptable for comprehensive database schema definition.

      **Test Documentation:**
      - Test files include headers documenting current schema version, migration, and update strategy
      - README.md in supabase/tests/ explains test approach and how to update tests for new migrations
      - Test coverage: 37 tests across 3 test suites (schema validation, constraints, RLS policies)

      priority: low
      effort: small
      rationale: "Prevent documentation confusion and broken references"

      priority: low
      effort: small

# Compliance Verification
compliance:
  coding_standards:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      SQL formatting is clean and consistent. Comments explain WHY not WHAT. Naming conventions follow snake_case for database objects (tables, columns, indexes, constraints, policies).
      File exceeds coding standard target of <200 lines (670 lines) but this is ACCEPTABLE for comprehensive database schema migration covering 9 tables with full RLS policies and documentation.
      Function and trigger naming follows conventions (trigger_set_timestamp, set_timestamp_{table}).

  project_structure:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Migration file correctly placed in supabase/migrations/ directory with timestamp prefix (20251003041821).
      Follows Supabase convention for migration naming: {timestamp}_{description}.sql
      File organization follows logical sections: trigger functions, tables (by category: core, companies/URLs, taxonomy, booking system), FK constraints, RLS policies.

      Test files correctly placed in supabase/tests/ directory with clear naming (schema-validation.test.ts, constraints.test.ts, rls-policies.test.ts).

  testing_strategy:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Story defined comprehensive testing requirements in Testing section (lines 420-738) covering:

# Final Assessment
assessment_summary: |
  Story 1.1 v2.0 delivers a COMPREHENSIVE, WELL-ARCHITECTED, FULLY-TESTED database schema that fully implements the v2.4 data model requirements. The migration file demonstrates EXCELLENT database design practices with proper constraints, indexes, RLS policies, and documentation. The comprehensive test suite (37 tests, 100% passing) provides full validation of schema structure, constraint enforcement, and security policies.

  **Schema Implementation: EXCELLENT (95/100)**
  - All 11 acceptance criteria implemented in schema (AC 1-11)
  - 9 tables created with correct structure and 112+ total columns
  - 31 constraints (11 CHECK, 6 UNIQUE, 14 FOREIGN KEY) enforce data integrity at database level
  - 27 RLS policies provide fine-grained access control with coordinator override pattern
  - 20+ indexes optimize common query patterns (FKs, composite indexes, partial indexes)
  - 25+ table/column comments provide comprehensive documentation
  - Audit trail support on all core tables (created_by, updated_by, deleted_by)
  - Soft delete capability on 4 appropriate tables (availability, time_slots, bookings, entity_tags)
  - Hierarchical taxonomy with self-referential FK
  - Polymorphic entity_tags pattern with proper documentation
  - Coordinator override pattern provides admin capabilities (scope expansion beyond ACs but good practice)

  **Test Coverage: EXCELLENT (100/100)**
  - 37 tests implemented, 100% passing
  - Schema validation tests (14 tests): All 9 tables verified with correct column structure
  - Constraint tests (8 tests): UNIQUE, CHECK, FK constraints enforced correctly
  - RLS policy tests (15 tests): Access control verified (public read, user-owned CRUD, coordinator overrides, soft delete filtering)
  - Test infrastructure complete: client helper, vitest config, README, .env.example
  - Test documentation: Headers with version tracking, update instructions for future migrations

  **Database Verification: COMPLETE**
  - All 9 tables verified in local database via psql queries
  - All constraints verified (31 total)
  - All indexes verified (20+ total)
  - All RLS policies verified (27 total)
  - All triggers verified (8 total)
  - No schema drift detected (supabase db diff clean)
  - Migration executed successfully (supabase db reset)

  **Gate Decision Rationale:**
  Gate status is PASS because:
  1. Schema implementation is PRODUCTION-READY and technically excellent
  2. Database verification confirms all tables, constraints, policies exist and function correctly
  3. Comprehensive test suite (37 tests, 100% passing) validates all schema components
  4. No blocking issues, data loss risks, or security vulnerabilities detected
  5. RLS policies are comprehensive and correctly scoped (verified by tests)
  6. Migration has been tested on clean database (verified via supabase db reset)
  7. All 11 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

  **Previous Gate Status:**
  - Initial review (2025-10-05 19:30): CONCERNS (70/100) due to missing tests
  - Updated review (2025-10-05 20:00): PASS (95/100) after comprehensive test suite implemented

  **Ready for Production:**
  This story is COMPLETE and ready to be marked Done. The database schema is production-ready with full test coverage validating all components.

next_steps:
  - "Mark story 1.1 as Done (all ACs met, comprehensive tests passing)"
  - "Optional: Create architecture/5-database-schema.md or update references (DOC-001 - LOW priority)"
  - "Optional: Document coordinator override policy design rationale (LOW priority)"

    gate: CONCERNS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "v2.0 comprehensive review - Complete v2.4 data model rewrite. Schema implementation EXCELLENT (9 tables, 31 constraints, 27 RLS policies, comprehensive documentation). However, ZERO tests exist despite story defining 6 test suites with 20+ test cases. Gate status CONCERNS due to missing test coverage, NOT due to schema quality issues."

  - at: "2025-10-05T20:00:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "v2.0 FINAL review - Comprehensive test suite implemented (37 tests, 100% passing). Schema validation, constraint enforcement, and RLS policies all verified. Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS. Story is COMPLETE and production-ready."
