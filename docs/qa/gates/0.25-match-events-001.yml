# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story demonstrates exceptional software engineering practices:

  1. ARCHITECTURE: Perfect implementation of event-driven cache updates with
     fire-and-forget pattern ensuring non-blocking API responses.

  2. RELIABILITY: Comprehensive error handling that logs failures but never
     throws, ensuring system stability even when individual operations fail.

  3. TEST COVERAGE: 18 integration tests covering all handlers, edge cases,
     and error scenarios. Tests are well-structured with Arrange-Act-Assert
     pattern and descriptive names.

  4. CODE QUALITY: Perfect adherence to all coding standards, excellent
     documentation, proper type safety, and clean separation of concerns.

  5. TECHNICAL DEBT: Not only avoided introducing debt but actually fixed
     2 pre-existing bugs discovered during review.

  The implementation is production-ready and can be merged immediately.
  Outstanding work by the development team!
