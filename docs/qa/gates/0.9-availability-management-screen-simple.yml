  FINAL RE-REVIEW (2025-10-06):

  ✅ GATE STATUS: FAIL → PASS

  The Dev successfully completed Option A re-implementation to align Story 0.9 with Story 0.8's actual API.
  All 4 critical schema mismatches have been resolved, and the implementation is now production-ready.

  VERIFICATION SUMMARY:
  ✅ GET /v1/availability endpoint added to Story 0.8 API
  ✅ Frontend form generates ISO datetime (proper date + time combination)
  ✅ Location field removed, meeting_type hardcoded to 'online'
  ✅ Response handling updated for API schema (meeting_type, location_custom, etc)
  ✅ All test mocks updated using centralized fixtures (excellent DRY implementation)
  ✅ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
  ✅ Test suite: 78 passing, 1 skipped (jsdom limitation)

  QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Centralized test fixtures (apps/web/src/test/fixtures/availability.ts) - Exemplary
  - Comprehensive inline documentation explaining API schema fields
  - Robust datetime parsing with regex fallback for error resilience
  - Clean helper functions (formatTimeFromISO, getLocationDisplay)

  MINOR QA FIX APPLIED:
  - Added type assertion to MSW request body in integration test (1 line)

  PRODUCTION READINESS: ✅ APPROVED
  - All acceptance criteria met
  - TypeScript type-safe throughout
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Clean, maintainable code
  - Proper error handling
  - Accessibility compliant

  Quality Score: 95/100 (A+)

  REVIEW HISTORY:

  Initial Review (2025-10-06):
  - Gate: CONCERNS (missing type generation)
  - Fixed: Toast variants, import paths, added vi import
  - Issue: Type generation not run

  Re-Review #1 (2025-10-06):
  - Gate: CONCERNS → FAIL (critical schema mismatch discovered)
  - Root Cause: Story 0.9 implemented against incorrect API assumptions
  - 4 critical issues identified (SCHEMA_MISMATCH_001-004)
  - Recommendation: Option A re-implementation

  Final Re-Review (2025-10-06):
  - Gate: FAIL → PASS (Option A successfully implemented)
  - All schema mismatches resolved
  - Excellent code quality with centralized fixtures
  - Production-ready

  LESSONS LEARNED FOR FUTURE STORIES:
  1. Always verify API contracts BEFORE implementing dependent frontend stories
  2. Generate and validate types as first step of frontend development
  3. Run integration tests against real API endpoints early
  4. Document API schema dependencies clearly in story prerequisites
