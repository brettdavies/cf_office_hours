schema: 1
story: "0.5"
story_title: "SKEL-API-002 - Auth Middleware (Basic)"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Exceptional implementation of basic auth middleware with comprehensive test coverage, strong security posture, and production-ready code quality. All acceptance criteria met. Rate limiting intentionally deferred to Epic 1 as documented in story scope."

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Strong JWT verification via Supabase Auth SDK. Proper secrets management. No information disclosure. Rate limiting deferred to Epic 1 (documented)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal middleware overhead. Stateless design appropriate for edge runtime. Single Supabase API call per request."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with 7/7 test coverage. All edge cases covered including missing headers, malformed tokens, and Supabase failures."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional code quality. Full TypeScript coverage, JSDoc on all exports, clear separation of concerns, zero technical debt."

# Recommendations

  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints when moving to Epic 1"
      refs: ["apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts"]
      priority: "medium"
      epic: "Epic 1"
    - action: "Consider JWT verification result caching in KV for high-traffic scenarios"

      epic: "Future optimization"

# Detailed findings
detailed_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Clean middleware pattern with proper async/await and error handling"
    - "Full requirements traceability: All 4 ACs mapped to comprehensive test scenarios"
    - "Security best practices: Delegated JWT verification to Supabase SDK, avoiding manual crypto"
    - "100% standards compliance with coding standards and architecture guidelines"
    - "Well-documented with JSDoc and inline comments explaining design decisions"
    - "Proper type safety with no use of 'any' types"
    - "Test coverage includes all critical paths and edge cases"
    - "Stateless design appropriate for Cloudflare Workers edge runtime"

  minor_observations:
    - "Rate limiting not implemented - documented deferral to Epic 1 (acceptable for Epic 0 scope)"
    - "No JWT result caching - acceptable for MVP, consider for high-traffic scenarios"

  test_quality:
    - "7 unit tests with proper mocking of Supabase client"
    - "Edge cases covered: missing header, malformed header, invalid token, error handling, default role"
    - "Protected test route created for manual integration testing"
    - "Manual testing procedures documented in story"

  architecture_notes:
    - "Proper separation: auth.ts (middleware) + db.ts (client factory) + types/ (definitions)"
    - "Dependency injection pattern for Supabase client (testable)"
    - "Hono context properly typed with Bindings and Variables"
    - "Error responses follow established format from Story 0.4"

# Requirements traceability matrix
requirements_mapping:
  AC1_jwt_verification:
    requirement: "requireAuth middleware verifies Supabase JWT tokens"
    tests:
      - "auth.test.ts:66-90 - Invalid JWT returns 401"
      - "auth.test.ts:92-126 - Valid JWT injects user context"
      - "auth.test.ts:159-177 - Supabase errors return 500"
      - "db.test.ts:11-22 - Client creation"
    status: "PASS"

  AC2_user_context_injection:
    requirement: "User context injected into request: c.set('user', user)"
    tests:
      - "auth.test.ts:92-126 - User object with id/email/role set correctly"
      - "auth.test.ts:128-157 - Default role to mentee if missing"
    status: "PASS"

  AC3_401_errors:
    requirement: "401 error for missing/invalid tokens"
    tests:
      - "auth.test.ts:33-49 - Missing Authorization header → 401"
      - "auth.test.ts:51-64 - Malformed header → 401"
      - "auth.test.ts:66-90 - Invalid JWT → 401"
    status: "PASS"

  AC4_no_role_checking:
    requirement: "No role checking yet (added in Epic 1)"
    tests:
      - "Code review confirms no RBAC logic present"
      - "Story explicitly documents Epic 1 deferral"
    status: "PASS"
