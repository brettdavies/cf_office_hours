- **Notes**: Pending implementation of Story 14 (SKEL-NOTIF-001: Basic Email Notifications) in Epic 0. Should send booking confirmation emails to both mentor and mentee on booking creation.

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Test 22: Direct Navigation While Logged Out
- **Steps**: Log out, navigate directly to `/dashboard`
- **Expected**: Redirected to `/auth/login`, console log shows ProtectedRoute redirect
- **Actual**: Redirected to `/auth/login` successfully. Console logs: `[AUTH] Initializing auth hook`, `[AUTH] getSession result` hasSession: false, `[AUTH] No session found in getSession`. User remained on login page without access to dashboard.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Protected route correctly blocks unauthenticated access with proper logging.

---

### Test 23: Browser Back Button After Login
- **Steps**: Login, navigate to profile, click browser back button
- **Expected**: Navigate to previous page (not logout or login page)
- **Actual**: Navigated from `/profile` back to `/dashboard` successfully. Browser history navigation works correctly without triggering logout or redirecting to login page.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Browser back button correctly uses navigation history without interfering with authentication state.

---

### Test 24: Console Errors Check
- **Steps**: Review browser console logs during all tests above
- **Expected**: No uncaught errors, no React warnings (hydration, key props, etc.)
- **Actual**: Console clean - no uncaught errors, no React warnings (hydration mismatches, missing keys, deprecated methods). All console output consists of intentional logging statements ([AUTH], [PROFILE], [SLOTS], [BOOKING], [BOOKINGS], [AVAILABILITY], [API]).
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Application logging comprehensive and well-structured. No unexpected errors or warnings throughout testing session.

---

## Email Whitelist Validation

### Test 25: New Whitelisted User Signup
- **Steps**: Sign up with email that exists in raw_mentees, raw_mentors, or raw_users
- **Expected**:
  - Magic link sent successfully
  - User created in auth.users and public.users
  - Correct role assigned from whitelist
  - User can access dashboard
  - API middleware allows access (200 responses)
- **Actual**: Tested with three whitelisted emails from different role tables. All three successfully: received magic link, created user records in auth.users and public.users, assigned correct role from whitelist (mentee, coordinator, mentor), accessed dashboard, received 200 OK responses from API.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Email whitelist validation working correctly. Roles properly assigned based on source table (raw_mentees → mentee, raw_users → coordinator, raw_mentors → mentor).

---

### Test 26: Non-Whitelisted User Blocked
- **Steps**: Attempt to sign up with email NOT in any raw tables
- **Expected**:
  - No magic link sent (blocked before Supabase Auth call)
  - No auth.users record created
  - No public.users record created
  - Error message shown to user
- **Actual**: Tested with `blocked.user@notwhitelisted.com`. Signup blocked successfully. Error toast displayed: "Database error saving new user". Console logs: `[AUTH] Magic link sent` success: false, error: 'Database error saving new user', `[ERROR] Magic link send failed`. Network: POST `/auth/v1/otp` returned 500 Internal Server Error. No magic link email sent. No user records created in database.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Database trigger (validate_email_whitelist) correctly prevents non-whitelisted user creation. Error message could be more user-friendly (currently shows "Database error" instead of "Email not whitelisted"), but security validation working correctly.

---

### Test 27: Existing Whitelisted User Login
- **Steps**: Log in with existing user who is in whitelist
- **Expected**:
  - Magic link sent
  - User can authenticate and access dashboard
  - API middleware validates whitelist (200 responses)
- **Actual**: Tested with `alice.brown@phoenix-networks.example` (existing user). Magic link sent successfully, user authenticated, accessed dashboard. All API calls returned 200 OK (profile, bookings, navigation). Whitelist validation passed in API middleware.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Existing whitelisted users can successfully log in and all API endpoints validate whitelist correctly.

---

### Test 28: User Removed from Whitelist (Active Session)
- **Steps**:
  1. User is logged in with active session
  2. Remove user's email from all raw tables (raw_mentees/raw_mentors/raw_users)
  3. User clicks any navigation button or makes API call
- **Expected**:
  - API returns 403 Forbidden
  - Console log: `[AUTH] API call failed with 403 Forbidden, signing out`
  - User immediately signed out
  - Redirected to login page
  - No fallback to default role
- **Actual**: User removed from whitelist (alice.brown@phoenix-networks.example). Navigated to Profile page. API returned 403 Forbidden. Console log: `[AUTH] API call failed with 403 Forbidden, signing out` with endpoint and timestamp. User immediately signed out, auth state cleared, token removed from localStorage. Redirected to `/auth/login`. Auto-signout working correctly.
- **Status**: ☑ PASS  ☐ FAIL
- **Notes**: Fixed - Added 403 interceptor in api-client.ts that clears auth state, signs out from Supabase, and redirects to login page.
